# NLP Project - Abstracting Terms of Service Documents
The final project of my MIDS DATASCI266 - Natural Language Processing class.
The objective of the final project was to train and fine-tune various large language models to predict sentence importance and create abstract summaries of Terms of Service (ToS) documents.
Models such CNNs, BERTs, T5, and GPT were all explored. The final pipeline used involved BERT, T5, and GPT, resulting in high BERTScores for summaries. 

## Contents
### Collaborators: Nicholas Lin, Yoni Nackash, Sophie Chance

Dataset: Webscraped from a community-driven ToS higlighter called ToS:DR

### Repo Files:
Each folder contains the steps we used to build up to the final pipeline. This includes data collection, preprocessing, model training, and model evaluation.
The final report can be seen under the reports folder.
